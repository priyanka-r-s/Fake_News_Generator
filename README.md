# Fake_News_Generator
**📖 Project Description**
Fake News Generator is a fun and educational Python-based application that automatically generates humorous and fictional news headlines. The project randomly combines different subjects, actions, places, and extra details to form fake news statements. It demonstrates the use of randomization, lists, and string manipulation in Python.
This project helps beginners understand how Python can be used to create creative applications and also highlights how easily fake news can be generated digitally.
**🎯 Objectives**
To understand the use of random module in Python
To practice list handling and string formatting
To demonstrate how fake news can be artificially generated
**⚙️ Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Python 3
Modules Used: random
Platform: Windows / Linux / macOS
**🧠 Working of the Project**
The program stores different lists such as subjects, actions, places, and extras.
Using the random module, one item is selected randomly from each list.
These selected values are combined into a single sentence.
The final sentence is displayed as fake news.
**▶️ How to Run**
Install Python 3 on your system.
Download or copy the project files.
Open command prompt / terminal in the project folder.
Run the program using the command:
python fake_news.py
A new fake news message will be generated each time you run the program.
**📝 Sample Output**
A scientist promised flying cars by next year in New Delhi which went viral instantly.
**📌 Conclusion**
This Fake News Generator project is a simple demonstration of Python programming concepts such as randomization, list operations, and string formatting. It provides an engaging way to understand how fake news can be created programmatically while improving Python coding skills.
